# Course-project-Getting-and-Cleaning-Data
Project made for Cousera's Data Science Specialization class on getting and cleaning data

This file will provide an overview of the process followed to obtain a tidy data file
The data was obtained from this URL: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
A full description of the data can be found in this URL: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

# Steps

1. Download and unzip the files.
2. Then created a script (also found in this repo) called "run_analysis.R" that: Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set, extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement, uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set, appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity name, and finally creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

# More information

Some more information about the data and its variables is available in the CodeBook.MD file.
